 <h2>
 The EFEF Meetings
 </h2>
 <p>
 <ul>
 The European Finite Element Fair (EFEF) is an annual series of completely informal small workshops throughout Europe with equal initial conditions for each speaker. EFEF provides a platform for high-level discussions on current research on finite element approximation, in the broadest sense, of partial differential equations. Authors are encouraged to present *one* new idea rather than review a full research project. In this spirit, the communication of recent and new results, even not yet published, is very welcome (see The Book, item 4 below). A few, but strict, rules apply to EFEF in order to distinguish it from existing workshops and mini-symposia in the field.
 </ul>
  </p>

 <h2>
 Format of the Meeting
 </h2>
 <ul>
 <li> Speakers at EFEF are volunteers from the audience. Provided that he or she is present throughout the meeting, each participant is invited to talk.  </li>
 <li> Based on the number of speakers the time available will be divided into slots for the talks. The order of the speakers will be determined through random choice, by drawing names out of a hat. Speakers cannot request a specific time to talk. </li>
 <li> Each speaker should introduce themself, the title, and the topic, and is expected to leave sufficient time, within the allocated time slot, for discussion. Speakers have to prepare a talk that can be trimmed to various lengths (from seconds to 30 minutes). For a smooth meeting, the timetable will be strictly enforced. </li>
 <li> The Book: Starting from EFEF 2005, a book will be available (in the Oberwolfach tradition) to record new analytical and numerical results presented during EFEF. Results can be hand-written or typeset and glued into the book. </li>
 </ul>
